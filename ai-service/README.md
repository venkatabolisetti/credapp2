# CredAI Service

The AI Operations Assistant backend for CredPay - a FastAPI
microservice that reasons over telemetry already collected by
Prometheus, Kubernetes, and Azure Monitor to answer operational
questions in plain language.

This service **adds** to CredPay; it does not modify any existing
service, Deployment, or pipeline. See `docs/Architecture.md` for the
full design.

## What CredAI is not

- Not a dashboard. Grafana already exists for that (`observability/grafana/`).
- Not a replacement for Prometheus/Kubernetes/Azure Monitor - it only
  *reads* from all three; none of them changed.
- Not a chatbot with general knowledge - every answer is grounded in
  CredPay's own telemetry, or the model says so.

## Quick start (local development)

```bash
cd ai-service
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate   # Windows; use `source .venv/bin/activate` on Linux/macOS
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Minimum required environment variables (see docs/API-Documentation.md
# "Environment Variables" for the full list):
export OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://your-resource.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/your-project/openai/v1/responses"
export OPENAI_KEY="your-key"
export OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT="your-deployment-name"
export OPENAI_API_VERSION="2025-08-07"

uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8010
```

Then open `http://localhost:8010/docs` for interactive Swagger UI.

Outside a cluster, the Kubernetes, Azure Monitor, and Log Analytics
clients disable themselves automatically (see `docs/Architecture.md`,
"Graceful degradation") - only Prometheus (if reachable) and Azure
OpenAI are required for local development.

## Running against the real cluster

Prometheus is only reachable at `prometheus.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:9090`
*from inside* the AKS cluster. For local development against real data,
port-forward it first:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/prometheus 9090:9090
```

Then set `PROMETHEUS_URL=http://localhost:9090` before starting Uvicorn.
