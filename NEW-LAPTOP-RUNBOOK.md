# CredPay — Fresh Fork Runbook (Zero to Live Blue/Green)

This is a **complete, start-from-nothing runbook**. It assumes you have
**never touched this project before**, have **no existing Azure resources**,
and are starting from a **brand-new laptop**. Follow it top to bottom and
you will end with:

- Your own copy of this repo, on your own GitHub account
- Your own Azure infrastructure (network, AKS, PostgreSQL, Key Vault, ACR)
- Your own Azure DevOps pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys automatically
- The app live on the internet, with blue/green frontend deploys you can
  watch flip on every push

No step here assumes prior Azure, Kubernetes, Terraform, or CI/CD
experience — every command is given in full, and every "why" is explained
inline. If you get stuck, the **Troubleshooting** section (near the bottom)
covers the real problems past students hit and exactly how they were fixed.

> **If you're joining a teammate who already has all of this running**
> (shared Azure infra, existing pipeline), you don't need most of this
> document — skip straight to [Appendix B](#appendix-b--joining-an-existing-environment).

## 1. What you're building

```
 Your GitHub repo (main branch)
        │  git push

                                       installed (both idempotent), reads
                                       secrets from Key Vault, creates the
                                       K8s Secret, deploys the DB schema
                                       Job, rolls out user-service &
                                       payment-service (rolling update),
                                       rolls out the frontend to whichever
                                       of blue/green is idle, smoke-tests
                                       it, and only then flips live traffic
                                       to it
```

Three kinds of Azure resources are involved, and it matters which ones
Terraform creates for you and which ones **you** create by hand once,
up front (the same pattern real companies use for a container registry —
you don't want your database and your image registry to have the same
lifecycle):

| Resource | Who creates it | When |
|---|---|---|
| Resource Group, VNet, AKS, PostgreSQL, Log Analytics | **Terraform** (`terraform apply`) | Step 4 below |
| Azure Container Registry (ACR) | **You**, manually, once | Step 2 below |
| Storage Account for Terraform's own state file | **You**, manually, once | Step 2 below |
| Azure Key Vault | **You**, manually, once | Step 2 below |

---

## 2. Prerequisites — install these first

| Tool | What it's for | Check it's installed |
|---|---|---|
| [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) | Cloning/pushing the repo | `git --version` |
| [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) | Everything Azure-related | `az --version` |
| [Terraform CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) 1.6+ | Provisioning infra | `terraform --version` |
| [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) | Talking to the cluster | `kubectl version --client` |
| [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) | Installing the Ingress controller (one-time) | `helm version` |
| Node.js 20+, Java 21 + Maven, Python 3.11+ | *Only* if you want to build/run the app locally before deploying (optional) | `node -v`, `java -version`, `python --version` |

`az aks install-cli` installs `kubectl` for you if it's missing.

You also need:
- A **GitHub account**.
- An **Azure subscription** (a free trial or student subscription is fine —
  the resources this project creates are small/cheap, but remember to
  `terraform destroy` when you're done to avoid ongoing charges).
- An **Azure DevOps organization** — create one free at
  [dev.azure.com](https://dev.azure.com) if you don't have one.

---

## 3. Fill in your own values

Every Azure resource name below must be **globally unique across all of
Azure**, not just unique to your subscription — if you reuse the exact
names from this repo's own working example (`credpay`, `credproj`, etc.),
your commands will fail with a "name already taken" error, because someone
already owns those names. Pick your own short, unique tag — your name,
initials, or student ID work well — and derive every name below from it.
See [Appendix A](#appendix-a--azure-resource-naming-rules) for the exact
character rules per resource type.

Fill in this table on paper (or a scratch file) before starting — every
step below refers back to it:

| Placeholder | Example value | What it becomes |
|---|---|---|
| `<PREFIX>` | `credpay-alex` | Terraform's `name_prefix` → resource group `rg-<PREFIX>`, AKS cluster `aks-<PREFIX>`, PostgreSQL server `psql-<PREFIX>` (must satisfy Postgres's own naming rules — lowercase letters, digits, hyphens — see Appendix A) |
| `<ACR_NAME>` | `alexcredpayacr` | Your Container Registry, e.g. `alexcredpayacr.azurecr.io` |
| `<STATE_RG>` | `alex-tfstate-rg` | Resource group holding Terraform's state storage account |
| `<STATE_STORAGE>` | `alextfstate001` | Storage account for the `.tfstate` file |
| `<KV_NAME>` | `kv-alex-credpay` | Your Key Vault |
| `<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>` | `11111111-2222-...` | `az account show --query id -o tsv` |
| `<LOCATION>` | `canadacentral` | Azure region — pick one close to you |
| `<GITHUB_USERNAME>` | `alexdev` | Your GitHub username |
| `<NEW_REPO_NAME>` | `credpay-alex` | The name of **your** new (empty) GitHub repo |
| `<ADO_ORG>` | `alexdev` | Your Azure DevOps organization name |
| `<ADO_PROJECT>` | `CredPay` | Your Azure DevOps project name |

---

## 4. Step 1 — Lift and shift the repo to your own GitHub

1. On GitHub, create a **new, empty repository** named `<NEW_REPO_NAME>`
   (do **not** initialize it with a README/.gitignore — it must be empty).

2. Clone the original project, strip its git history, and push it as a
   fresh repo of your own:

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/Bharathreddyd3297/CredApp.git <NEW_REPO_NAME>
   cd <NEW_REPO_NAME>

   # Remove the original project's git history entirely
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .git

   # Start a brand-new history as your own repo
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial import"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<GITHUB_USERNAME>/<NEW_REPO_NAME>.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

From here on, every `git push` you make goes to **your** repo, and (once
Step 6 is done) triggers **your** pipeline against **your** Azure
subscription. Nothing you do from here touches the original project.

---

## 5. Step 2 — Create your Azure bootstrap resources

Log in first:

```powershell
az login
az account list --output table
az account set --subscription "<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"
az account show --output table
```

### 5.1 Resource group + storage account for Terraform's state file

Terraform needs somewhere to durably store its own state — this is a
one-time, manually-created "bootstrap" resource, deliberately **outside**
of what Terraform itself manages (so you can't accidentally destroy your
own state backend with `terraform destroy`).

```powershell
az group create --name <STATE_RG> --location <LOCATION>



az storage account create `
  --name <STATE_STORAGE> `
  --resource-group <STATE_RG> `
  --location <LOCATION> `
  --sku Standard_LRS `
  --encryption-services blob

az storage container create `
  --name statefile `
  --account-name <STATE_STORAGE> `
  --auth-mode login
```

### 5.2 Azure Container Registry (ACR)

This is where your Docker images (frontend, user-service, payment-service)
live. Also created out-of-band, same reasoning as above.

```powershell
az acr create `
  --name <ACR_NAME> `
  --resource-group <STATE_RG> `
  --sku Basic
```

(It's fine to put the ACR in `<STATE_RG>` alongside the state storage
account — or any resource group you already have. It does **not** need to
be in the same resource group Terraform will create for the app.)

### 5.3 Azure Key Vault

This is where Terraform will push your PostgreSQL credentials, for the
pipeline to read back later. Also created out-of-band.

```powershell
az keyvault create `
  --name <KV_NAME> `
  --resource-group <STATE_RG> `
  --location <LOCATION> `
  --enable-rbac-authorization true
```

`--enable-rbac-authorization true` puts the vault in **Azure RBAC** mode
(the modern option) rather than the older "vault access policy" model.
**This matters** — see the Troubleshooting section if you ever get a `403
Forbidden ... does not have secrets get permission` error later; it almost
always means a vault is in the *other* mode than you expect.

Grant **yourself** permission to write secrets into it for now (you'll
grant the pipeline's identity the same permission in Step 6):

```powershell
az role assignment create `
  --assignee "$(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv)" `
  --role "Key Vault Secrets Officer" `
  --scope "$(az keyvault show --name <KV_NAME>  
```

Role assignments can take a minute or two to propagate — if the next step
fails with a permissions error immediately after this, just wait a bit and
retry.

---

## 6. Step 3 — Edit the repo for your environment

This project deliberately hardcodes environment-specific values instead of
using placeholder templating (`k8s/README.md` calls this out explicitly) —
simpler to read, at the cost of needing a few find-and-replace edits when
moving to a new environment. Here is the exact, complete list.

### 6.1 `terraform/main.tf` — line 7

```hcl
locals {
  name_prefix = "credpay"   # <-- change to <PREFIX>
```

Every resource name Terraform creates derives from this one value.

### 6.2 `terraform/backend.tf` — the whole file

Terraform backend blocks cannot reference variables, so this must be
hand-edited:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "CredProj"        # <-- change to <STATE_RG>
    storage_account_name = "credprojstate"   # <-- change to <STATE_STORAGE>
    container_name       = "statefile"       # leave as-is
    key                  = "credpay.terraform.tfstate"  # leave as-is
  }
}
```

### 6.3 `terraform/terraform.tfvars`

This file is **committed to git in this repo** (intentionally, for
classroom simplicity — see `PORTABILITY.md` §A for the full reasoning and
trade-off). Replace these four values with your own:

```hcl
subscription_id = "<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"
location        = "<LOCATION>"

key_vault_name                 = "<KV_NAME>"
key_vault_resource_group_name  = "<STATE_RG>"
```

(`postgres_admin_username`, `database_name`, node sizes, etc. can stay as
their defaults — they aren't globally unique and don't need to change.)

> **Heads up:** because this file is committed, your own Azure subscription
> ID will be visible in your own GitHub repo's history. That's an accepted
> trade-off for a personal/learning subscription — just don't leave real
> production credentials in a public repo this way.

### 6.4 `k8s/configmap/configmap.yaml`

The database hostname here is hardcoded and depends on `<PREFIX>` — but you
won't know its exact value until **after** Step 4 creates it. Come back to
this file after Step 4 and update:

```yaml
DB_HOST: "psql-credpay.postgres.database.azure.com"   # <-- your psql-<PREFIX> FQDN
...
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL: "jdbc:postgresql://psql-credpay.postgres.database.azure.com:5432/credpay?sslmode=require"
```

Get the real value with `terraform output -raw postgres_fqdn` (Step 4
shows exactly when to run this).

### 6.5 Image references — 4 files

Replace `credproj.azurecr.io` with `<ACR_NAME>.azurecr.io` in:

- `k8s/frontend/deployment-blue.yaml`
- `k8s/frontend/deployment-green.yaml`
- `k8s/user-service/deployment.yaml`
- `k8s/payment-service/deployment.yaml`

(Only the `image:` line in each — the repository path after the hostname,
e.g. `credpay/frontend`, can stay the same.)

### 6.6 `azure-pipelines.yml` — the `variables:` block near the top

```yaml
variables:
  acrServiceConnection: 'CredPay-ACR-SC'   # <-- your ACR service connection name (Step 6)
  azureServiceConnection: 'scnew2'         # <-- your ARM service connection name (Step 6)
  acrName: 'credproj'                      # <-- <ACR_NAME> (the registry itself, not the connection above)

  tfStateRG: 'CredProj'                    # <-- <STATE_RG>
  tfStateStorage: 'credprojstate'          # <-- <STATE_STORAGE>
  tfStateContainer: 'statefile'            # leave as-is
  tfStateKey: 'credpay.terraform.tfstate'  # leave as-is

  aksResourceGroup: 'rg-credpay'           # <-- rg-<PREFIX>
  aksClusterName: 'aks-credpay'            # <-- aks-<PREFIX>
  k8sNamespace: 'credpay'                  # leave as-is, just a namespace name

  keyVaultName: 'kv-credpay'               # <-- <KV_NAME>
  keyVaultResourceGroup: 'CredProj'        # <-- <STATE_RG>
```

You won't have real service connection names until Step 6 — it's fine to
edit this file again after Step 6, before your first push.

---

## 7. Step 4 — Run Terraform once, from your laptop

Run this **from your own laptop first** (not via the pipeline yet). This
mirrors exactly how this project itself was originally built — get it
working manually and debuggably before automating it — and lets you fix
any typos from Step 3 quickly, with full error output in front of you,
rather than digging through CI logs.

```powershell
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan     # review what it's about to create
terraform apply    # type "yes" to confirm
```

If this succeeds, you'll see output including:

```
aks_cluster_name       = "aks-<PREFIX>"
aks_resource_group     = "rg-<PREFIX>"
key_vault_name         = "<KV_NAME>"
postgres_fqdn          = "psql-<PREFIX>.postgres.database.azure.com"
```

**Now go back and finish §6.4** — update `k8s/configmap/configmap.yaml`
with the real `postgres_fqdn` value shown above, then commit that change.

Verify the Key Vault actually received the four secrets:

```powershell
az keyvault secret list --vault-name <KV_NAME> --query "[].name" -o table
# expect: postgres-host, postgres-db-name, postgres-username, postgres-password
```

```powershell
cd ..
```

---

## 8. Step 5 — One-time cluster setup (ACR attach + Ingress controller)

Both of these are **cluster-level** settings, needed once ever, right after
the cluster is created — and **the pipeline now does both for you
automatically**, every run (the "Attach ACR to AKS" and "Ensure Ingress
Controller Installed" steps in `azure-pipelines.yml`, right after "Get AKS
Credentials"). Both are idempotent — `az aks update --attach-acr` and
`helm upgrade --install` are safe to re-run on every deploy, and only
actually change anything the first time. **You don't need to do anything
in this section for the pipeline to work.**

It's still worth connecting `kubectl` to your new cluster yourself, so you
can inspect it directly instead of only ever seeing it through pipeline
logs:

```powershell
az aks get-credentials --resource-group rg-<PREFIX> --name aks-<PREFIX> --overwrite-existing
kubectl get nodes
```

This cluster is created with **Azure RBAC for Kubernetes authorization**
enabled (`terraform/modules/aks/main.tf` sets `azure_rbac_enabled = true`),
so `kubectl` access is gated by an Azure role assignment on the cluster
*resource* — being subscription `Owner` does **not** grant it (same
control-plane vs. data-plane split as the Key Vault note above). If
`kubectl get nodes` comes back `Forbidden: ... does not have access to the
resource in Azure`, grant yourself a role on this specific cluster:

```powershell
az role assignment create `
  --assignee "$(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv)" `
  --role "Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Cluster Admin" `
  --scope "$(az aks show --resource-group rg-<PREFIX> --name aks-<PREFIX> --query id -o tsv)"
```

**This is per-cluster** — if you already did this for an earlier
cluster (a previous stage, a renamed `<PREFIX>`), it does not carry over
to a new one; re-run the command above with the new cluster's `--scope`.
Role assignments can take a minute or two to propagate.

> **metrics-server** (needed by the HPAs) is already built into AKS — no
> installation step needed, by you or the pipeline.

> If you ever need to do the ACR-attach or Ingress-controller install
> manually (e.g. debugging outside the pipeline), here's what the pipeline
> itself runs:
> ```powershell
> az aks update --resource-group rg-<PREFIX> --name aks-<PREFIX> --attach-acr <ACR_NAME>
>
> helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
> helm repo update
> helm upgrade --install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx `
>   --namespace ingress-nginx --create-namespace
> ```

---

## 9. Step 6 — Set up Azure DevOps

### 9.1 Create the project and connect it to your GitHub repo

1. Go to [dev.azure.com](https://dev.azure.com), sign in, and create a new
   **Organization** (`<ADO_ORG>`) if you don't already have one.
2. Create a new **Project** named `<ADO_PROJECT>`.
3. In the project, go to **Pipelines → Create Pipeline → GitHub**, and
   authorize Azure DevOps to access your GitHub account if prompted.
4. Select your `<NEW_REPO_NAME>` repository.
5. Choose **Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file** → branch `main` → path
   `/azure-pipelines.yml`.
6. Click **Save** (the dropdown next to "Run") — don't run it yet, you
   still need the service connections below.

### 9.2 Create two service connections

Go to **Project Settings (bottom-left) → Service connections → New service
connection**:

**a) Azure Container Registry connection** (type: **Docker Registry** →
**Azure Container Registry**):
- Subscription: yours
- Azure container registry: `<ACR_NAME>`
- Service connection name: e.g. `MyCredPay-ACR-SC`
- ✅ Grant access permission to all pipelines

**b) Azure Resource Manager connection** (type: **Azure Resource Manager**
→ **Service principal (automatic)**):
- Scope level: **Subscription**
- Subscription: yours
- Service connection name: e.g. `my-arm-sc`
- ✅ Grant access permission to all pipelines

This second connection creates a new Azure AD **service principal** (an
identity for the pipeline itself, separate from your own user login) and
by default grants it **Contributor** on your subscription — enough for
Terraform to create the VNet/AKS/PostgreSQL/Log Analytics resources, but
**not** enough on its own for everything the pipeline does — see §9.3.

### 9.3 Grant that service principal the three extra permissions it needs

Find its Object ID: **Project Settings → Service connections → (your ARM
connection) → Manage Service Principal** (opens the App Registration in
the Azure Portal) → copy the **Application (client) ID**, then:

```powershell
$SP_OBJECT_ID = az ad sp show --id "<APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID>" --query id -o tsv
```

**Key Vault — write secrets:**

```powershell
az role assignment create `
  --assignee $SP_OBJECT_ID `
  --role "Key Vault Secrets Officer" `
  --scope "$(az keyvault show --name <KV_NAME> --query id -o tsv)"
```

> If your vault is in the older **access-policy** model instead of RBAC
> (you'd only see this if you skipped `--enable-rbac-authorization true` in
> §5.3), use this instead — RBAC role assignments are silently ignored on
> access-policy vaults:
> ```powershell
> az keyvault set-policy --name <KV_NAME> --object-id $SP_OBJECT_ID --secret-permissions get list set delete
> ```

> **This role assignment is scoped to one specific vault — it does not
> carry over if you ever point `key_vault_name` at a different vault**
> (a rename, a new environment/stage sharing the same pipeline, etc.).
> Subscription-level `Owner`/`Contributor` on the service principal does
> **not** substitute for it either: those built-in roles only grant Azure
> **control-plane** `actions`, while Key Vault secret read/write is a
> **data-plane** `dataAction` — a vault-scoped data role like `Key Vault
> Secrets Officer` is the only thing that grants it. Re-run the command
> above with the new vault's `--scope` any time `<KV_NAME>` changes.

**AKS — admin access for `kubectl` from the pipeline:**

```powershell
az role assignment create `
  --assignee $SP_OBJECT_ID `
  --role "Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role" `
  --scope "$(az aks show --resource-group rg-<PREFIX> --name aks-<PREFIX> --query id -o tsv)"
```

This is a plain Azure RBAC role on the cluster *resource* itself (separate
from Kubernetes' own in-cluster permissions) — the pipeline's `az aks
get-credentials --admin` step needs it to fetch a working kubeconfig
non-interactively.

**ACR — permission to attach it to AKS:**

```powershell
az role assignment create `
  --assignee $SP_OBJECT_ID `
  --role "User Access Administrator" `
  --scope "$(az acr show --name <ACR_NAME> --query id -o tsv)"
```

This one is easy to miss: `az aks update --attach-acr` (which the pipeline
now runs automatically every deploy) works by creating a role assignment
under the hood — granting the AKS kubelet identity `AcrPull` on your
registry. Creating role assignments needs
`Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write`, a permission the default
**Contributor** role from §9.2 deliberately excludes. `User Access
Administrator`, scoped to just the ACR (not the whole subscription), is
the least-privilege way to grant exactly that.

### 9.4 Update `azure-pipelines.yml` with your real connection names

Go back to §6.6 and fill in `acrServiceConnection` /
`azureServiceConnection` with the exact names you gave the two service
connections above. Commit and push this change.

---

## 10. Step 7 — Push and watch it deploy

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Configure for my own Azure environment"
git push
```

In Azure DevOps, go to **Pipelines** and watch the run. It goes through
three stages — `Terraform` → `DockerBuild` → `DeployToAKS` — each takes a
few minutes. Expand the **Final Validation** step's log at the end; a
successful run ends with:

```
==================================================
 PROD ENVIRONMENT IS CURRENTLY RUNNING ON: BLUE
 BROWSE TO THE APP AT: http://<your ingress IP>/
==================================================
```

The **Final Validation** step already looks up the Ingress controller's
public IP and prints the exact URL — no separate `kubectl` command needed.
Open that URL in a browser and walk through: register → login → add card
→ pay a bill → payment history.

(If that line instead says the controller has no public IP yet, the
Azure Load Balancer is still provisioning — re-run the pipeline in a
couple of minutes, or check directly with
`kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx ingress-nginx-controller`.)

---

## 11. How blue/green works day-to-day

After this first run, every future `git push` to `main`:

1. Rebuilds and pushes fresh Docker images.
2. Detects whichever frontend color (`blue`/`green`) is **not** currently
   live, and rolls the new image out to it only — the live color is left
   completely untouched, still serving real traffic.
3. Runs a smoke test directly against the new color's pods (`GET /`,
   `GET /api/users/health`, `GET /api/payment/health`) — **before** it
   receives any real traffic.
4. Only if all three pass does it flip the live Service to the new color.
   If the smoke test fails, the pipeline stops there — the previous color
   keeps serving traffic, nothing user-facing ever broke.

So a normal day-to-day loop is just: make a change, `git push`, watch the
pipeline, and check the closing banner to see which color is now live —
it alternates on every successful push.

**Your data is safe across every one of these pushes.** The "Run Database
Schema Job" step runs on every deploy too, but `schema.sql` is
non-destructive — `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` plus seed rows that only
insert into an empty table — so any real user you register, card you add,
or payment you make through the live app survives every future push
untouched. Only a genuinely empty, fresh database ever gets the demo seed
data.

## 12. Troubleshooting

These are the real problems hit while building this exact pipeline —
in order of how early in the process they tend to show up.

**`Error: subscription ID could not be determined and was not specified`**
during `terraform apply` — you skipped or mistyped §6.3; double check
`subscription_id` in `terraform/terraform.tfvars` is your real subscription
ID, not the placeholder.

**`403 Forbidden ... does not have secrets get permission on key vault`**
— your vault is in access-policy mode, not RBAC mode, so the `Key Vault
Secrets Officer` role assignment silently does nothing. Check with:
```powershell
az keyvault show --name <KV_NAME> --query properties.enableRbacAuthorization
```
`false`/empty → use `az keyvault set-policy` (shown in §9.3) instead.

**PowerShell says `Missing expression after unary operator '--'`** when you
paste a multi-line `az` command — PowerShell doesn't support bash's `\`
line continuation. Either put the command on one line, or use PowerShell's
backtick `` ` `` continuation (every multi-line command in this document
already uses backticks for you).

**`terraform apply` fails on every `azurerm_key_vault_secret` resource**
with `403 Forbidden ... Action: 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/getSecret/action' ...
Assignment: (not found)'` — the pipeline's service principal is missing
`Key Vault Secrets Officer` on **the vault your config currently points
at**. This bites people most often after switching `key_vault_name` in
§6.3 to a new/renamed vault (e.g. running this project again for a new
stage) — the role assignment from §9.3 was granted on the *old* vault and
doesn't automatically carry over. Check what the SP actually has:
```powershell
az role assignment list --assignee $SP_OBJECT_ID --all -o table
```
If the current `<KV_NAME>` isn't in the list, re-run the §9.3 `az role
assignment create` command with `--scope` pointed at the current vault.
Having `Owner`/`Contributor` on the subscription does **not** fix this —
those roles don't grant Key Vault `dataActions`, only a vault-scoped data
role does.

**`kubectl get nodes`/`get svc` fails with `Forbidden: ... nodes is
forbidden ... does not have access to the resource in Azure`** when you
run it yourself (as opposed to the pipeline) — your own account is missing
the `Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Cluster Admin` role on **this specific
cluster**, per the note in §8. Just like the Key Vault 403 above, this is
scoped per-cluster and subscription `Owner`/`Contributor` doesn't cover
it — most commonly hit right after standing up a new cluster (new
`<PREFIX>`, new stage) when you already had access to an older one. Fix:
```powershell
az role assignment create `
  --assignee "$(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv)" `
  --role "Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Cluster Admin" `
  --scope "$(az aks show --resource-group rg-<PREFIX> --name aks-<PREFIX> --query id -o tsv)"
```

**The pipeline's "Get AKS Credentials" step fails** — the service
principal from your ARM connection is missing the `Azure Kubernetes
Service Cluster Admin Role` from §9.3. This is a separate role from the
Key Vault one; both are required.

**The pipeline's "Attach ACR to AKS" step fails** with something like
`does not have authorization to perform action
'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write'` — the service principal
is missing `User Access Administrator` on the ACR from §9.3. This is the
one gotcha that's easy to miss: `Contributor` (the default from §9.2)
deliberately cannot create role assignments, and attaching ACR to AKS
creates one internally.

**Pods stuck in `ErrImagePull` / `ImagePullBackOff`** — check with
`kubectl describe pod <name> -n credpay`. Usually means §6.5 was missed —
all four `image:` lines must point at `<ACR_NAME>.azurecr.io`, not
`credproj.azurecr.io`. Also confirm `acrName` in `azure-pipelines.yml`
(§6.6) matches your real ACR name — the pipeline's "Attach ACR to AKS"
step silently attaches the wrong (or a nonexistent) registry otherwise.

**"Ensure Ingress Controller Installed" step fails with `helm: command not
found`** — unlikely on Microsoft-hosted `ubuntu-latest` agents (Helm ships
preinstalled), but if your organization uses a different/custom agent pool,
add a `HelmInstaller@1` task immediately before that step.

**That same step fails with `ServiceAccount "ingress-nginx" ... cannot be
imported into the current release: invalid ownership metadata`** — this
means an ingress-nginx controller already exists in the cluster but wasn't
installed via Helm (e.g. someone applied its static YAML manifests by
hand). The pipeline checks for the controller's `Service` first and only
runs `helm upgrade --install` if it's missing, specifically to avoid this
— if you still hit it, the controller likely exists under a different
Service name than `ingress-nginx-controller`; check with
`kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx`.

**Known issue: your subscription ID lives in `terraform/terraform.tfvars`,
committed on purpose** — Azure DevOps secret pipeline variables can't be
expanded into a `TerraformTask@5` `commandOptions` input (only into script
`env:` mappings), so passing `subscription_id` as a pipeline variable
silently resolves to empty and breaks `terraform apply` in CI. Committing
the real value in `terraform.tfvars` is the accepted tradeoff for this
classroom capstone (see §6.3). A subscription ID isn't a login credential,
but Azure treats it as sensitive (it's the target for resource enumeration)
— **if you ever fork this repo to make it public, that value stays in git
history even after you stop tracking the file going forward.** Fully
removing it requires rewriting history (`git filter-repo` or BFG
Repo-Cleaner) and a force-push, which is destructive to anyone else's clone
— do this only if you understand the tradeoff, and coordinate with anyone
else who has cloned the repo first.

## Step 2: Log in to GoDaddy
Log in to your GoDaddy account.
Go to My Products.
Find your domain.
Click DNS or Manage DNS.

You'll see a table with DNS records.

Step 3: Add an A Record

If you want the root domain:

https://yourdomain.com

Create:

## 13. Reference: every environment-specific value, in one table

| File | What to change |
|---|---|
| `terraform/main.tf` | `locals.name_prefix` (line 7) |
| `terraform/backend.tf` | `resource_group_name`, `storage_account_name` |
| `terraform/terraform.tfvars` | `subscription_id`, `location`, `key_vault_name`, `key_vault_resource_group_name` |
| `k8s/configmap/configmap.yaml` | `DB_HOST`, `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` (after Step 4) |
| `k8s/frontend/deployment-blue.yaml` | `image:` |
| `k8s/frontend/deployment-green.yaml` | `image:` |
| `k8s/user-service/deployment.yaml` | `image:` |
| `k8s/payment-service/deployment.yaml` | `image:` |
| `azure-pipelines.yml` | `acrServiceConnection`, `azureServiceConnection`, `acrName`, `tfStateRG`, `tfStateStorage`, `aksResourceGroup`, `aksClusterName`, `keyVaultName`, `keyVaultResourceGroup` |

This mirrors (and supersedes, for a from-scratch setup) the checklist in
`PORTABILITY.md` — that document also covers the security reasoning behind
committing `terraform.tfvars` in more depth.

## Appendix A — Azure resource naming rules

These bit people every time — check before you pick names in §3:

| Resource | Rule |
|---|---|
| Storage Account (`<STATE_STORAGE>`) | 3–24 chars, **lowercase letters and digits only**, no hyphens, globally unique |
| ACR (`<ACR_NAME>`) | 5–50 chars, **alphanumeric only**, no hyphens/underscores, globally unique |
| Key Vault (`<KV_NAME>`) | 3–24 chars, letters/digits/hyphens, must start with a letter, globally unique |
| PostgreSQL server (derived from `<PREFIX>`) | 3–63 chars, **lowercase letters, digits, hyphens**, globally unique (exposed as a public hostname) |
| Resource Group, AKS cluster (derived from `<PREFIX>`) | Letters/digits/hyphens/underscores, unique only within *your* subscription (not globally) |

Because the PostgreSQL server name is the strictest of the ones derived
from `<PREFIX>` (lowercase + hyphens only, globally unique), pick a
`<PREFIX>` that satisfies that rule and the rest will automatically be
fine.

## Appendix B — joining an existing environment

If someone else has already run through this whole document (shared
Azure infra, existing Azure DevOps pipeline) and you're just getting a new
laptop set up to work on the same project:

1. Skip Steps 1–6 entirely.
2. Clone the **existing** repo (not a fresh one) and check out `main`.
3. `az login` with an account that has access to the existing subscription.
4. `az aks get-credentials --resource-group <existing RG> --name <existing AKS name> --overwrite-existing`.
5. `kubectl get pods -n credpay` — if you see pods Running, you're already
   looking at a live environment; just `git push` as normal to deploy
   changes through the existing pipeline.

You do **not** need your own ACR, Key Vault, or state storage account in
this scenario — you're using the ones the project already has.
